# Bloglist app - FullstackOpen 2022

- This is made for:

  - Try Monorepo for both frontend and backend.
    - Well... not really, I just copied contents of both repos.
    - See [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10516201/updating-and-committing-only-a-files-permissions-using-git-version-control), to make `.sh` executable.
  - Try CI/CD with `Github Actions`, in particular [this](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/expanding_further) exercise.
    - Try [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/).
  - maybe try TypeScript.
  - Maybe sometime try `Deno` / `Deno Deploy`.
  - Reference repos (won't be maintained after this one works):
    - [Backend](https://github.com/OoMiDOoO/bloglist-backend)
    - [Frontend](https://github.com/OoMiDOoO/bloglist-frontend)
