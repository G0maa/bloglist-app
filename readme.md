# Bloglist app - FullstackOpen 2022

- This is made for:

  - Try [Monorepo](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/create-app) for both frontend and backend.
    - Well... not really, I just copied contents of both repos.
  - Try CI/CD with `Github Actions`, in particular [this](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/expanding_further) exercise.
    - Try [Deta](https://www.deta.sh/).
  - Try TypeScript.
  - Maybe sometime try `Deno` / `Deno Deploy`.
  - Reference repos (won't be maintained after this one works):
    - [Backend](https://github.com/OoMiDOoO/bloglist-backend)
    - [Frontend](https://github.com/OoMiDOoO/bloglist-frontend)

- What I need to do in a Monorepo:
  - Install both,
  - lint both
  - build both
  - start production
  - ...
